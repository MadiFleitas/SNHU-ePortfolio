        <h1>Artifact 2: Web-Based Inventory App</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This artifact is a web-based version of the original inventory management app, redesigned with JavaScript for a modern web environment. It includes features such as item sorting, searching, and caching to optimize performance. The project aims to provide a seamless inventory management experience across different devices.</p>
        <h2>Justification</h2>
        <p>I chose this artifact because it showcases my skills in implementing algorithms and optimizing data structures for better performance. The project demonstrates the ability to adapt an application for web-based use while improving the efficiency of its core functions through optimized algorithms for sorting and searching.</p>
        <h2>Enhancement Reflection</h2>
        <p>Enhancing this project allowed me to delve deeper into algorithm optimization and caching techniques. The process involved implementing a caching mechanism to reduce the number of database queries and improve response time. This experience enhanced my understanding of performance optimization in web applications.</p>
