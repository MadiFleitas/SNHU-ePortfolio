        <h1>Artifact 2: Web-Based Inventory App</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This artifact is a web-based version of the original inventory management application, redesigned using JavaScript for a modern web environment. It includes features such as item sorting, searching, and caching to optimize performance. The project aims to provide a seamless inventory management experience across multiple devices, making it more accessible to users compared to the original Android-only version.</p>

        <h2>Justification</h2>
        <p>The Web-Based Inventory App was selected as an artifact because it demonstrates my skills in optimizing algorithms and data structures for a more efficient and responsive application. The project showcases my ability to adapt an application for web-based use while improving the efficiency of its core functionalities through optimized algorithms for sorting and searching inventory data.</p>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> The primary programming language used to implement the web app's features, including dynamic content updates and event handling.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML/CSS:</strong> Used to create the user interface and style the web app, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across different devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Utilized for backend development, providing server-side functionality and handling data requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Express.js:</strong> A web framework for Node.js, used to create RESTful API endpoints for data access and manipulation.</li>
            <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> The database used for data storage, supporting CRUD operations and complex queries to manage inventory data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>Developing the web-based version of the inventory management system presented several challenges, particularly in optimizing data handling and ensuring the application was responsive across different devices. Additionally, implementing efficient caching mechanisms to reduce the number of direct database queries required careful analysis and testing to achieve the desired performance improvements.</p>

        <h2>Solutions Implemented</h2>
        <p>To address the challenges of data optimization, caching was implemented to temporarily store frequently accessed data, reducing the number of database queries. Sorting algorithms were optimized for better performance, especially when handling large inventories. Additionally, the search functionality was improved to support real-time filtering, allowing users to quickly find specific items without experiencing delays.</p>

        <h2>Enhancement Reflection</h2>
        <p>The enhancements made to this artifact involved optimizing the data handling techniques and algorithms used throughout the application. These enhancements included:
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing a caching mechanism for frequently accessed data to minimize database queries and improve response times.</li>
                <li>Optimizing sorting algorithms to handle large datasets efficiently and provide a smoother user experience.</li>
                <li>Enhancing search functionality to support real-time filtering, making it easier for users to find inventory items quickly.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These changes resulted in a more responsive and user-friendly web app, demonstrating my skills in improving software performance through effective use of algorithms and data structures.</p>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>Working on the Web-Based Inventory App provided valuable insights into web development and performance optimization. I learned how to implement caching strategies to improve the speed of data retrieval and optimize algorithms to handle large datasets efficiently. This project also helped me understand the importance of designing a responsive user interface that works well across multiple devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, I plan to explore more advanced optimization techniques and integrate additional performance monitoring tools to further enhance the app's efficiency.</p>
