        <h1>Artifact 1: Inventory Management Android App</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This artifact is an Android app developed for managing inventory items. It was initially created during a mobile development course and includes features such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting inventory records. The app was built using Kotlin and leverages a local database for data persistence.</p>
        <h2>Justification</h2>
        <p>I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my skills in software design and engineering. The project showcases my ability to create a functional and user-friendly application, handle data persistence, and apply software architecture principles. Enhancements included migrating the app's core functionality to a web-based platform to expand accessibility.</p>
        <h2>Enhancement Reflection</h2>
        <p>While enhancing this artifact, I learned about cross-platform development challenges and refined my skills in software design. The process involved restructuring the app's architecture to make it compatible with a web-based framework, which required significant adaptation of the existing code. This enhancement improved the app's usability by making it accessible from both mobile and web platforms.</p>
