# Professional Self-Assessment

As I near the completion of my Computer Science program, I reflect on how the coursework
and ePortfolio development have prepared me for a career in this field. Throughout my studies,
I have gained valuable skills, identified my strengths, and refined my professional goals. 
The process of building my ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase these skills and demonstrate my growth across several key areas.

Working on various projects throughout the program has shaped my professional goals. I discovered my passion for designing software that provides practical solutions and for working with data structures to improve performance. These interests led me to specialize in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases, which form the foundation of my ePortfolio.



## Program Impact

The Computer Science program has provided a well-rounded education, with courses covering topics such as software development, algorithms, databases, security, and team collaboration. These experiences helped me understand my strengths, such as problem-solving and adapting to new technologies. Through the process of creating this ePortfolio, I could consolidate my learning and gain deeper insights into my work, further enhancing my skills and confidence.


## Skills Development

Throughout the program, I developed several skills that are critical for a career in computer science:

Communicating Technical Concepts: I learned to explain complex technical details to both technical and non-technical audiences, which is crucial for clear and effective communication in any professional setting.

Data Structures and Algorithms: I gained proficiency in using and optimizing data structures and algorithms to solve problems efficiently.

Software Engineering: I enhanced my software design skills by building applications across different platforms, such as Android and web-based systems.

Database Management: I learned to design databases, write queries, and integrate data solutions into applications. Working with both relational and non-relational databases has prepared me to manage data-driven projects.

Security: I applied security principles to protect data, ensuring best practices for data handling in the projects I developed.

## Artifact Summary

The three artifacts included in my ePortfolio represent my growth and competencies in the key categories of Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases:

Inventory Management Android App (Software Design and Engineering): This project began as an Android app for managing inventory and evolved to demonstrate my skills in user interface design, software architecture, and transitioning to a different platform (web-based application).

Web-Based Inventory App (Algorithms and Data Structures): The web version of the inventory app showcases my ability to implement caching mechanisms and optimize algorithms for data sorting and searching, which improved the system's performance.

Web-Based Dashboard with Database Integration (Databases): This artifact illustrates my capabilities in database design and management, using MongoDB to handle complex data queries and integrating a web dashboard for data visualization and analysis.
