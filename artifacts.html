        <h1>Artifacts</h1>
        <p>This Inventory Management System project showcases my skills and growth in software development through the development of three key artifacts. The project was completed in three stages, each focusing on enhancing a specific set of skills in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management.</p>
        
        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>The Inventory Management System started as a simple Android application designed for managing inventory items, supporting basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. As the project evolved, the system was expanded into a web-based JavaScript application to enhance accessibility and user experience across multiple platforms. Finally, the project incorporated a database-enhanced web dashboard for data visualization and analysis, providing a comprehensive solution for inventory management.</p>
        <p>Each stage of the project highlights different aspects of software development, including cross-platform development, optimization of data handling, and efficient database integration. The evolution of this system demonstrates a well-rounded approach to problem-solving in computer science, leveraging various technologies and methodologies to create an effective, real-world application.</p>

        <h2>Artifacts and Their Significance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="artifact1.html">Artifact 1: Inventory Management Android App</a> - 
                <p>Initially developed during a mobile development course, this artifact demonstrates my abilities in software design and engineering. The Android app was built using Kotlin and supports basic CRUD operations for managing inventory items. The app architecture follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, which separates the app's data handling logic from its user interface, allowing for more maintainable and scalable code. Enhancements to this artifact focused on improving the user interface, optimizing database interactions, and making the app more robust by implementing data validation techniques.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="artifact2.html">Artifact 2: Web-Based Inventory App</a> - 
                <p>The web-based inventory management application showcases my skills in optimizing algorithms and data structures. Built with JavaScript, the application introduces features like item sorting, searching, and caching to improve data retrieval performance. The system uses a modular approach, with components organized to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Enhancements included implementing a caching mechanism for frequently accessed data, optimizing sorting algorithms for better performance, and improving the efficiency of the search functionality to handle large datasets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="artifact3.html">Artifact 3: Web-Based Dashboard with Database Integration</a> - 
                <p>This artifact illustrates my database management capabilities, integrating MongoDB as the backend to support complex data queries and analysis. The web-based dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing inventory data, with features such as interactive charts and real-time data updates. Enhancements to this artifact focused on refining the database schema for better data organization, optimizing queries for performance, and integrating advanced data visualization tools to present meaningful insights to users.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <p>Throughout the development of these artifacts, several technical challenges were encountered and overcome. In the Android app, managing data synchronization between the local database and the user interface was complex, especially when dealing with concurrent data updates. Implementing the MVVM architecture and using LiveData helped solve these challenges by ensuring a reactive data flow. For the web-based app, optimizing algorithms for sorting and searching required careful analysis to improve performance, particularly for large inventories. Implementing caching reduced the number of repeated data queries, significantly improving load times.</p>
        <p>The database integration stage involved complex data aggregation and real-time updates in the web dashboard. This required efficient query design and optimization techniques to ensure that the dashboard remained responsive, even with large datasets. Using MongoDB's aggregation framework and indexing strategies helped achieve the desired performance improvements.</p>

        <h2>Lessons Learned and Future Enhancements</h2>
        <p>The process of creating and enhancing these artifacts has provided valuable lessons in software engineering, including the importance of scalable architecture, algorithm optimization, and efficient data handling. Future enhancements could involve integrating authentication for multi-user support, implementing role-based access control, and expanding the dashboard's analytics capabilities to include predictive modeling for inventory trends.</p>
