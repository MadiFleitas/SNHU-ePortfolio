        <h1>Artifact 3: Web-Based Dashboard with Database Integration</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This artifact is a web-based dashboard designed to display and manage inventory data using MongoDB as the backend database. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing inventory data, including features such as interactive charts, data filtering, and real-time updates. It offers insights into inventory levels, recent changes, and other key metrics, helping users manage inventory more efficiently.</p>

        <h2>Justification</h2>
        <p>The Web-Based Dashboard was selected as an artifact because it illustrates my skills in database management, data visualization, and web development. The project demonstrates the ability to design and implement a database solution, create efficient data queries, and integrate data visualization tools into a web-based interface. Enhancements to this artifact focused on refining the database schema for better data organization, optimizing queries for performance, and integrating advanced data visualization features.</p>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Used for client-side interactivity and to create dynamic content in the dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML/CSS:</strong> Utilized for building the structure and styling of the web-based dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Provides server-side functionality, allowing for communication with the MongoDB database and data processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Express.js:</strong> A web framework for Node.js used to set up API endpoints for managing inventory data.</li>
            <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> The primary database used for data storage, supporting complex queries and real-time updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Chart.js:</strong> A JavaScript library used to create interactive charts and graphs for data visualization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>One of the main challenges in developing this dashboard was ensuring that the data visualizations were responsive and updated in real-time as the underlying data changed. Additionally, optimizing database queries to handle large datasets efficiently was crucial to maintaining the dashboard's performance. The design of the database schema also needed careful consideration to support complex data aggregation and filtering operations.</p>

        <h2>Solutions Implemented</h2>
        <p>To ensure real-time updates, I used WebSockets to enable two-way communication between the server and the client, allowing the dashboard to receive live updates from the database. For handling large datasets, I implemented indexing in MongoDB to speed up query execution. The database schema was refined to organize data more logically, making it easier to perform aggregation operations and generate meaningful insights.</p>

        <h2>Enhancement Reflection</h2>
        <p>The enhancements made to this artifact involved improving the data management and visualization techniques used throughout the dashboard. These included:
            <ul>
                <li>Refining the database schema to better support data aggregation and complex queries.</li>
                <li>Optimizing database queries by implementing indexing strategies to improve performance for large datasets.</li>
                <li>Integrating interactive charts using Chart.js to allow users to explore data visually, with support for filtering and drill-down features.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These enhancements resulted in a more efficient and interactive dashboard that provides users with valuable insights into inventory trends and performance.</p>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>Working on the Web-Based Dashboard with Database Integration provided an opportunity to deepen my knowledge of full-stack development, particularly in the area of database management and data visualization. I learned about the importance of indexing for query optimization, how to structure data for efficient aggregation, and techniques for creating interactive web interfaces. This project also emphasized the value of real-time data updates in providing an engaging user experience.</p>
        <p>In future projects, I plan to explore additional data visualization libraries and further optimize real-time data handling techniques for better performance.</p>
